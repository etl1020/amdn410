<h4> Financing Policies </h4>
<p> At this time, we do not offer any financing for our products. We believe that we offer all of our products at a fair and reasonable price. Bike tubes are not a particularly costly item, so most people shouldn't have trouble affording ours.
</p>

<h4> Delivery Policies </h4>
<p> We currently offer our products in several stores across the United States, and we always recommend supporting your local shops. We also offer free shipping if you are looking to purchase one of our products from our website.
</p>

<h4> Return Policies </h4>
<p> If you buy one of our products and are unhappy with the quality, you are more than welcome to call us and ask for a return. However, if the product is not faulty out of the package, we ask that you make your return request within 30 days of purchasing.
