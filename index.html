<h4> History </h4>
	<p> This company was founded on the principle of sustainability. We have noticed that the bike industry produces a significant amount of excess waste that ends up in landfills or the ocean. Many different companies offer recycling services to bike shops around the nation. However, we don't think that these programs are operating as effectively as they should be. We wanted to make a product that puts the responsibility into the consumers' hands, so we made a recyclable bicycle tube that can be disposed of in your everyday recycling and helps keep the world clean.</p>

<h4> Why use us? </h4>
	<p> We think that every cyclist should use our product. However, we know that will likely never be the case. If you are an environmentally conscious cyclist who uses your bike as an alternate means of transportation then you have come to the right place. Our product is there so that cyclists can have piece of mind that there popped tire isn't going to end up in floating trash island or in a landfill. </p>
